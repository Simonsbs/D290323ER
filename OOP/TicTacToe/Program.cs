		 * Step 1:
		 * 1. Build a class called GameBoard
		 * 2. add a field 2d array of char - that will represent the virtual game board
		 * 3. build a method called "ResetBoard" that sets all the values of the board to ' '
		 * 4. build a method called "DisplayBoard" that prints out the current state of the game board. ** BONUS - add some colors
		 * 5. build a method called "MakeMove" that updates the gameboard with the players move
		 * 6. build a method called "IsValidMove" that checks if the given move is valid, meaning in range and not taken place already
		 * 7. build a method called "CheckWin" that checks if a given 'X' or 'O' has won.
		 * 8. build a method called "IsBoardFull" that checks if the gameboard is full up.
